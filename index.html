            <h2>Why I Love Music</h2>
            <p>
                Music has been a pillar in my family for as long as i can remember. I honestly can't remember when I heard
                the first symphony hit my ear, my mom played music to me when I was still in her belly. Everyone in my
                family has some kind of musical ability. Most are singers, but some play instruments and there's me, a
                producer and poet. Music has saved my life plenty of times and I'm honestly <b>indebted</b> to music.
